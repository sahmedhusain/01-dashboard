## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Access to reboot01 platform credentials

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd graphql
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies and run:**
    The `run.sh` script simplifies common tasks. To install dependencies and start the development server, run:
    ```bash
    ./run.sh dev
    ```

3.  **Open your browser:**
    Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`.

4.  **Login:**
    Use your reboot01 platform credentials to access the dashboard.

### Available Commands

The `run.sh` script provides several commands:

```bash
./run.sh dev          # Start the development server
./run.sh test         # Run all tests
./run.sh build        # Create a production build
./run.sh deploy       # Prepare the project for deployment
./run.sh help         # Display all available commands
```

## üîß Configuration

The application uses a dynamic configuration system based on environment variables, eliminating hardcoded values.

1.  **Create a `.env` file:**
    Copy the example file to create your local configuration.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

2.  **Customize variables:**
    Update the `.env` file with your specific settings.

### Key Configuration Categories

-   **API Configuration**: `VITE_API_BASE_URL`, `VITE_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT`, etc.
-   **Authentication Settings**: `VITE_AUTH_TOKEN_KEY`, `VITE_AUTH_TOKEN_EXPIRY`, etc.
-   **UI Theme Customization**: `VITE_THEME_PRIMARY`, `VITE_THEME_SECONDARY`, etc.
-   **Feature Flags**: `VITE_FEATURE_ADVANCED_CHARTS`, `VITE_FEATURE_REALTIME_UPDATES`, etc.
-   **Performance Settings**: `VITE_CACHE_ENABLED`, `VITE_DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE`, etc.

The system supports different environments (`development`, `staging`, `production`) for tailored configurations.

## üöÄ Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)

1.  **Connect Repository**: Import the project to Vercel.
2.  **Configure Build Settings**:
    -   **Build Command**: `npm run build`

    -   **Install Command**: `npm install`
3.  **Environment Variables**: Set up the required environment variables in the Vercel dashboard.
4.  **Deploy**: Trigger a deployment. For automated deployments, use the `run.sh` script:
    ```bash
    ./run.sh deploy
    ```

### Manual Deployment

1.  **Build the project**:
    ```bash
    ./run.sh build
    ```
2.  **Deploy**: Deploy the contents of the `dist` folder to your hosting provider.
